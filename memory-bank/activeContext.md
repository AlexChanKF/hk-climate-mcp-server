# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Fixing unit tests for the server implementation
- Ensuring all project context is properly captured
- Establishing documentation standards for future updates
- Resolving packaging issue with tools directory

## Recent Changes
- Successfully fixed the unit test for `test_server.py`
- Updated packaging configuration to include `tools` directory files in the built package
- Created `MANIFEST.in` to specify inclusion of tool files
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to enable `include-package-data`
- Rebuilt package to confirm inclusion of tools
- Created all core memory bank files
- Updated projectbrief.md with actual project details
- Populated productContext.md with purpose and value proposition
- Documented technical stack in techContext.md
- Captured system architecture in systemPatterns.md

## Next Steps
- Update progress.md with current project status
- Review all documentation for completeness
- Establish regular memory bank update process

## Active Decisions
- Using standardized markdown format for all documentation
- Maintaining clear separation between different context types
- Prioritizing documentation completeness before adding details

## Important Patterns
- Following hierarchical documentation structure
- Linking related concepts across files
- Using consistent formatting and headers

## Learnings
- Memory bank is crucial for maintaining context
- Documentation should be updated incrementally
- Clear structure makes information easier to find
- Packaging configuration requires explicit inclusion of subdirectories
